[part The Boost SIMD Library
    [quickbook 1.5]

[section Overview]
Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) extensions have been a feature of choice for processor manufacturers
for a couple of decades. Designed to provide significant accellerations, they require expertise, the use of
potentially fragile compiler support, or vendor-specific libraries to be correctly and succesfully exploited.
Boost.SIMD is a C++ template library that aims to give a simple and powerful way to access the benefits of
SIMD extensions without suffering from these problems by providing standard compliant abstractions.

[warning Boost.SIMD is a library in development and is not part of Boost.]

[h2 Dependencies]
Boost.SIMD depends on the following header-only Boost libraries:

* Boost.Dispatch
* [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/fusion/doc/html/ Boost.Fusion]
* [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/mpl/doc/ Boost.MPL]
* [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/preprocessor/doc/ Boost.Preprocessor]
* [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/proto.html Boost.Proto]
